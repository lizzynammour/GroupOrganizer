# GroupOrganizer
### Login and Signup
A user first sees the Signup page when he opens the app. He inputs his username, password and email in order to signup. He can also choose to Login with his username and password.

### Personal Groups and Tasks
When the user logs in, he sees a Tabview, with the Groups he is in and his personal Tasks he has to complete.

### Groups
A user can select a group, which segues him to a Tab View, where he can see all the members of the group and can add members to the group, and where the other tab shows him all the tasks for the group and can create new tasks. 

### Tasks
A user can click on a task within, which causes the task to be transferred to his personal tasks. This means that the user is in charge of this task. An email will also be sent to all the members in the group, saying he is going to complete the task.

### Integration with Parse
All the data is stored and queried through parse.
